convert array in heap tree.,..
insert element as required position in tree and compare it with its parent and 
swap if reqired(in max heap swap when parent is samller and vise vrsa for minHeap)

*/

/*
Before that we should know how to convert an array to binary tree
rules:
i> root node is occupied at index 0.
ii> Left child of element is 2n+1 and right child is 2n+2 & parent node will be at (n-1)/2; where n is index of node(element)
